  layouts.

### Backend:

- **Node.js + Express**: Building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
- **GraphGL**: Building enhanced APIs.
- **Databases**: Working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, including MongoDB,
  basic level of understanding, but I'm improving it.
- **Swagger**: Create API documentation.

### Tools & Methodologies:

- **Version Control**: GitHub, Bitbucket for version tracking and collaboration.
- **Agile & Scrum**: Experienced in working within agile development teams and
  managing tasks in sprints.
- **Testing**: Basic skills in writing tests using Jest, my previous experience
  allows me to also secure user-flow issues.

  for several group projects during the course.

## üéØ What Drives Me

Grooming requirements, breaking it to tasks, solving problems and see the
result: I love seeing a project come to life. My QA background adds an extra
layer of discipline to my development process, ensuring that the applications I
create are not only functional but also reliable.

## üî® Personal Project

- **BagPack (2024-...)**: An application designed to help users manage every
  aspect of their trips in one place. The frontend is developed with TypeScript
